sidebar_label: 'Agent Definition'
---

All definitions can only be performed using Solution Manager.

Once the sma.acs.FiservDNA plugin has been registered with the OpCon system, it will be possible to perform agent definitions.

One of the features of the ACS FiservDNA implementation is that all configuration data is maintained within the OpCon environment and the ACS FiservDNA implementation uses this information to create unique file instances for each execution.
- SMARunDNAJob.ini file
- SMAOracleConnection.ini file
- environment.txt file
- SMAErrorWordsFile.txt

The **environment.txt** file and the **SMAErrorWordsFile.txt** information are stored as FiservDNA scripts, while the information for the **SMARunDNAJob.ini** and **SMAOracleConnection.ini** files are defined when configuring the ACS FiservDNA connector.

The ACS FiservDNA implementation also makes use of OpCon batch users to provide the required user and passwords for the network drive mappings, the SQT user and the Oracle user inserted into the SMAOracleConfiguration.ini file.

Before defining an agent connection, the appropriate scripts and batch users should be defined.

## Defining FiservDNA Batch Users

The ACS FiservDNA integration requires the following batch users:
- Each user associated with a Network Drive Mapping.
- The SQT user.
- The Oracle User.

![Defining a Batch User](../static/img/fiservdna-batch-user.png)

1.  Open Solution Manager.
2.  From the Home page select **Library**
3.  From the ***Security*** Menu select **Batch Users**.
4.  Select **+Add** to add a new Batch User.
5.  Select **Fiserv DNA** from the ***Select the target OS*** drop-down list.
6.  Enter the User name that will be used to create the token in the **Identifier** field.
7.  Enter the password of the defined API User in the **Password** and **Confirm** fields.
8.  Select **Save**.

## Defining FiservDNA Scripts

The ACS FiservDNA implementation uses two scripts to provide the **environment.txt** and **SMAErrorWordsFile.txt** files for each task execution. These scripts are requested during the ACS agent definition and the contents of each script is passed during task startup to enable the creation of unique files for each task.

Use existing **environment.txt** and **SMAErrorWordsFIle.txt** files from an existing FiservDNA legacy connector to provide the contents of each script.

## Defining ACS Fiserv DNA Agent

The Agent definition defines the information that is included in the generated **SMARunJobDNA.ini** file.
 
This is done by adding a new ACS Fiserv DNA Agent definition using Solution Manager. 

Items defined in red are required values (note : global properties are supported).
